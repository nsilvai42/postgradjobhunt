<div class="section-header">🧠 Psych Tip of the Week: <u>If-Then Plans</u></div>

<div class="section-text">
  <p>Without a concrete plan, no amount of motivation is enough. The fix is a simple brain hack called an "If-Then Plan" that automates your goals.</p>

  <div class="lead-text teal">
    <p>Make your plan concrete: <strong>IF</strong> it's <em>4PM on Tuesday</em>, <strong>THEN</strong> I'll <em>write a cover letter template</em>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Now, all your brain needs to do is follow the steps (the action) when it sees the trigger (then day and time).
  </p>

  <p class="lead-text teal" style="margin-top: 24px;">For each of your tasks above:</p>

  <ol class="styled-list">

    <li><strong class="black">Write down a specific day, time, and place you’ll do it. </strong><br>
      “If it’s Wednesday at 12 PM, and I’ve had lunch at home, I’ll request that informational interview with Contact X.”
    </li><br>

    <li><strong class="black">Think of what could go wrong—what might ruin that trigger.</strong> <br>
      “If my friend asks me out to lunch, I might not be at home.”
    </li><br>

    <li><strong class="black">Brainstorm 1–2 back-up plans in case it does.</strong> <br>
      “If that happens, I’ll set my alarm for Thursday at 9AM instead of 10AM to do it then.”
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>It might seem simple—but walking people through these plans <strong>more than doubles</strong> their chances of following through on everything from flu shots to job-search tasks.</p>
