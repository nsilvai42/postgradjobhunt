    Welcome to Sprint 3, <?!= firstName ?>!
  </p>

  <p>
     You've spent 2 months building skills and connections. This final month is about protecting that progress - <strong>77% of students who keep going land their job in month 3.</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here's the difference: successful job searchers treat month 3 as their breakthrough phase, not burnout phase.

  What Successful Job Searchers Do During This Phase

  <p>
    The students who land jobs during this final sprint consistently do one thing: they reach out to 3 new people each week, even when they don't feel like it. <strong>Why? A referred applicant is 4‚Äì10√ó more likely to get an interview than someone from the general pile.</strong></p>
    <p>Don't take our word - we asked a Job & Career Coach version of ChatGPT:
  </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; border-left: 3px solid #1c8a70; padding-left: 15px; margin-left: 15px;">
    "What is the one, highest impact career task that a recent grad can do this week, and what is your advice for someone that's feeling demotivated by having applied all summer and still not having a job?"

     You've already completed steps 2 and 3 that ChatGPT suggested, which means you're ahead of most job searchers:

      You have <a href="https://bottomlinecareer.org/informational-interview-templates">this template</a> you can use to reach out.
