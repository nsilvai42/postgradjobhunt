  <div class="section-header">Practice Telling Your Story</div>

  <div class="section-text">
    <p>An interview isn't just a test; it's a conversation where you get to tell your story. Companies don't hire resumes‚Äîthey hire people. Your unique experiences and perspective are what set you apart.</p>

     <p>This week, we're focusing on turning interviews into offers. It's time to practice, prepare, and ace the interview!</p>

     <p>Follow these steps to turn your experiences into compelling interview answers.</p>
     <p class="lead-text teal">Step 1: Outline Your Key Stories.</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Brainstorm 3-5 key experiences from your resume.</li>
      <li>For each, use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your story.</li>
      <li>Practice telling these stories out loud until they feel natural.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="lead-text teal">Step 2: Prepare for Common Questions.</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Draft answers to questions like "Tell me about yourself" and "Why are you interested in this role?" using the <a href="https://bottomlinecareer.org/interview-talking-points">Interview Talking Points</a> worksheet.</li>
      <li>Use <a href="https://bottomlinecareer.org/google-warmup-interview-practice">AI tools</a> to refine your answers and get feedback.</li>
      <li>Record yourself answering questions to check your pacing and body language.</li>

<div class="section-header">üß† Psych Tip of the Week: Cognitive Reappraisal</div>
<div class="section-text">
  <p>Facing a tough interview or a rejection? How you frame it matters. Instead of seeing it as a threat ("I'm going to fail"), re-frame it as a challenge ("This is a chance to show my skills").</p>
  <ol style="margin:16px 0 0 18px; padding:0; font-size:16px;">
    <li><strong>Identify the negative thought:</strong> "I'm not qualified for this job."</li>
    <li style="margin-top:12px;"><strong>Challenge it and re-frame it:</strong> "This role is a stretch, which makes it a great opportunity to learn. I'll focus on the qualifications I *do* have."</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="lead-text teal" style="margin-top:20px;">
   This small mental shift can reduce anxiety and improve performance by turning stress into a source of energy.
