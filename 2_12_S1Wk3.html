    I noticed you still haven't reached out to a contact for an informational interview: Remember,
    <em>about 75% of roles are filled through these sorts of chats!</em>
  </p>
  <p class="lead-text teal">
    Your only goal this week is to send <strong>one</strong> email asking for a coffee chat.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#1c8a70; margin-top:20px; font-size:18px;">
    Option 1: Reach out to a contact directly
  </h3>
  <div style="background-color:#f7f9f9; padding:15px; border-radius:5px; margin-bottom:15px;">
    <p>Hi [Contact's Name],</p>
    <p>
      I would love the opportunity to meet with you for an informational interview. [Add a little about yourself like
      grade level, major, school attending, and what you're interested in.] [Add a sentence about why this person sounds
      relevant to your interests.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd love to learn more about your current role and career path. [Add a couple specific topics or questions you'd
      like to talk about.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Would any of these times work for a 30-minute call?
    </p>
    <ul style="padding:0;">
      <li>[Example: Monday, 10/21 @ 10am and 4pm-8pm ET] ‚Äî don‚Äôt forget your time zone!</li>

    <p>Thank you!<br>Best,<br>[Your Name]</p>

  <h3 style="color:#1c8a70; margin-top:20px; font-size:18px;">
    Option 2: Asking a contact for a connection
  </h3>
  <div style="background-color:#f7f9f9; padding:15px; border-radius:5px;">
    <p>Hi [Contact's Name],</p>
    <p>
      I hope you‚Äôre doing well! [Insert an update about yourself, like where you‚Äôre at in school or a big decision
      coming up.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I‚Äôd love to learn more about [the major or career you‚Äôre interested in], and I was wondering if you know anyone
      who works in [the area you‚Äôre interested in] that you‚Äôd be comfortable connecting me with for an informational
      interview. I‚Äôd ask for a 30-minute call to learn more about their role, their employer, and their career path.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks so much for considering it!<br>Best,<br>[Your Name]</p>

<div class="section-text">
  <p>Did you know your brain thinks of your future self the same way it thinks of a complete stranger?</p>
  <p>
    <em>Anything that feels "far" in time, space, or even social 'closeness' feels more abstract.</em>
    It's hard to work so that an abstract "stranger" gets to benefit months from now.
  </p>
  <p class="lead-text teal" style="margin-top:24px;">
    <strong>There are ways to reduce this psychological distance.<br>In a blank document:</strong>
  </p>
  <ol class="styled-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Write 3 sentences <em>from</em> your future self,</strong> to your current self describing the feeling of
      having landed your new role. Be as specific as possible.
      <ul style="margin-top:5px; font-size:15px; color:#555;">
        <li><em>"I'm a few months into my job as a [Job Title] at [Company]..."</em></li>
        <li><em>"That feeling of relief when I got the offer was incredible..."</em></li>
        <li><em>"Thank you for not giving up. The hard work you're doing right now is what made this possible."</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This closes the distance between you and your future. It makes the reward feel real and personal,
    giving you a powerful reason to work hard for that person‚Äîbecause that person is you.
